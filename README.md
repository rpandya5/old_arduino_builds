## Projects Overview

### 1. Blinking LED
Basic introduction to Arduino using PWM to control LED brightness. 

### 2. Digital Read Serial
Using a button to send digital inputs to Arduino and reading the values through Serial communication. Introduces concepts of digital input and serial monitoring.

### 3. Temperature Sensor
Reading analog values from a temperature sensor and converting them to sound using a piezo buzzer. Covers analog input, mapping values, and working with sensors.

### 4. DC Motor Control
Controlling a DC motor's speed using transistors and PWM. Introduces motor control and the importance of current management in circuits.

### 5. DC Motor Control with H Bridge
Using an H-Bridge to control both speed and direction of a DC motor. Builds on previous motor control concepts and introduces directional control.

### 6. Reflective Object Sensors
Working with IR sensors to detect objects and trigger LED responses. Covers sensor input and conditional programming.

### 7. RF Communication
Building a wireless communication system using RF transmitter and receiver modules. 

## Usage
Each project folder contains:
- Arduino code (.ino file)
- Detailed README explaining the concepts

Open the individual project folders for specific instructions and explanations.

## Notes
These projects were completed in order of increasing complexity. If you're new to Arduino, starting with the Blinking LED project is recommended.
