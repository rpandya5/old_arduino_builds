Core concepts:

- Serial Monitor: Lets you send and receive messages from your computer and arduino. Must initialize communication through Serial.begin(n), which sets up communication at n bits per second.

- digitalRead(pin number): Allows you to read the value of the input pin, and find out if its 1 (high) or 0 (low).

- Serial.println(): Similar to a print statement in python. Used to print values to the serial monitor.

- If Statements: Create conditional actions within your program. If the condition is met, the code under the if block is executed. If not, executes code under the else block. Can also create multiple conditions using elif.
